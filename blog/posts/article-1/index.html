      <p>Golf’s expensive. Green fees, overpriced drivers, throw on top the $7 cart beers and it all adds up fast.</p>
      <p>But here’s the secret: you don’t need a $600 putter to enjoy yourself. You just need a few cheap gadgets that make the game smoother, funnier, and a little less humiliating.</p>
      <p>This isn’t a gear snob list. We’re not talking about clubs designed by NASA engineers.</p>
      <p>These are weekend warrior weapons. Gadgets for the beer-drinking golfer. Stuff that earns its spot in the bag.</p>
